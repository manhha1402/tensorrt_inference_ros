# TensorRT Inference ROS

This project integrates TensorRT inference with ROS2 (Robot Operating System). It provides a framework for deploying deep learning models optimized with TensorRT in a ROS2 environment.

## Features

- TensorRT model optimization and inference
- ROS2 nodes for running inference
- Example launch files and configurations
- Support for various deep learning models (YOLO, Retinaface, VGGFace, PaddleOCR, ...)
